		<p>A wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.</p>
		<p>But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep.</p>
		<p>The lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the wolf in the sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.</p>
