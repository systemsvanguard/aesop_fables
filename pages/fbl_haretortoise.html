		<p>The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals.</p>

		<p>"I have never yet been beaten," said he, "when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me."</p>

		<p>The Tortoise said quietly, "I accept your challenge."</p>

		<p>"That is a good joke," said the Hare; "I could dance round you all the way."</p>

		<p>"Keep your boasting till you've beaten," answered the Tortoise. "Shall we race?"</p>

		<p>So a course was fixed and a start was made.</p>

		<p>The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap.</p>

		<p>The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race.</p>

		<p>Then said the Tortoise: <span class="moral">"Plodding wins the race."</span></p>
		<p class="moral">Slow and steady wins the race.</p>
